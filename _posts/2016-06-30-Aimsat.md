One of the most amazing events in contemporary history was the launch of the first human-made satellite, the Sputnik-1. Early satellite radio amateurs could remember and identify the characteristic sound it made. Nowadays we live in a world where satellites are an everyday commodity, there are thousands of them orbiting the skies, sending back to Earth all kind of data: from live images of the atmosphere or from the deep-space, to data from their on-board experiments with live info of their results; however we are no longer existed in listening them.

AimSAT MX tries to bring back that excitement of listening satellites by directing people how to listen to them in an easy-to-understand format with instructions on what kind of equipment you need, and how to point your antenna, with helpful mobile apps in Android an iOS, when a Low Earth Orbit Satellite passes across the sky.
